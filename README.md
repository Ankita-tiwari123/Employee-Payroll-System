🧾 Employee Payroll System

Employee Payroll System using Java and OOPs Concepts

📘 Project Overview

The Employee Payroll System is a simple Java-based application designed to manage employee records and calculate payroll efficiently. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
